Invoke as: pdf_rename <dirpath>

This prints out title, author and metadata for each pdf.

Additionally, a file "tmp.csv" is created (in the directory from which
pdf_rename was invoked) that contains the same info.

FIXME should probably be called "pdf_print_meta" or similar, since it
doesn't actually rename
